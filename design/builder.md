# Design a work flow builder [LLD]

## Overview
Design a workflow automation system similar to a marketing automation platform that allows users to create, manage and execute automated sequences of actions. 
The system should:

#### Requirements
**Core Features**
 - Allow users to create workflows with multiple types of actions
 - Support branching logic based on conditions.
 - Enable time-based delays between actions.
 - Provide status tracking for workflow instances.

**Supported Actions**
 - Send Messages on apps like Instagram, Whatsapp, SMS etc...
 - Adding delays b/w actions.
 - Making HTTP API Calls.

**Optional**
 - How would you think about adding undo & redo functionality in a workflow?


### Guide for interviewee
 1. You will have to address the data model for the system as well.
 2. You don't actually need to implement functionality to send an Instagram, WA message or call an API but rather design our code to acheive such actions easily.
